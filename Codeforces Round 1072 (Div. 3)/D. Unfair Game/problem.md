Bob is tired of losing to Alice and, to ensure he doesn't lose again, decided to choose a game in which he is guaranteed to win. Bob has thought of a number from 1
 to n
, where it is known that n=2d
 for some non-negative integer d
. Initially, Alice knows whether the chosen number is even or not.

In one move, Alice can either halve the number or subtract 1
. Alice can only halve the number if the current number is even. Only Alice takes turns.

After her move, Alice receives a response from Bob: either −1
, which means the number has become 0
 and Alice has won, or a non-negative integer x
. If we denote the current number as a
, then for x
 the following conditions hold simultaneously:

a
 is divisible by 2x
.
a
 is not divisible by 2x+1
.
For example, if a=5
, then x=0
, since 5
 is divisible by 20=1
 and not divisible by 21=2
, and if a=12
, then x=2
, since 12
 is divisible by 22=4
 and not divisible by 23=8
.

It can be shown that for any integer a>0
, there exists a unique such x
.

Bob is still afraid that Alice will win, so the game will have no more than k
 moves. Additionally, Bob wants to maximize his chances of winning, so he wants to play as many games as possible. Given n
 and k
, calculate the number of initial numbers from 1
 to n
 such that Alice, playing optimally, cannot win in no more than k
 moves.

Input
The first line contains an integer t
 (1≤t≤104)
 — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains 2
 integers n
 and k
 (1≤n,k≤109)
 — the limit on the chosen number and the maximum number of Alice's moves, respectively. It is guaranteed that n=2d
 for some non-negative integer d
.

Output
For each test case, output the number of integers from 1
 to n
 such that Alice, playing optimally, cannot win in at most k
 moves.

Note
In the first sample, a=2
, a=3
, and a=4
 are suitable because from a=1
 one can reach 0
 in 1
 operation, while for the other values, it can be shown that at least 2
 operations are required.

In the second sample, a=3
 and a=4
 are suitable because for a=2
, Alice can win in 2
 operations.

In the third, fourth, and fifth samples, there are no suitable a
, because for a=3
 and a=4
, Alice can win in 3
 operations.
