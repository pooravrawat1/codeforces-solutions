ou are given an array of n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
.

The value of an array is the sum of the maximums of each prefix of the array. More formally, the value of an array a
 is ∑ni=1max(a1,…,ai)
. For example, the value of the array [1,2,1
] is max(1)+max(1,2)+max(1,2,1)=1+2+2=5
.

You can choose two indices i
 and j
 and swap elements ai
 and aj
; this operation can be applied at most one time.

Find the maximum possible value of the array a
 after at most one operation.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤50
) — the length of the array a
.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤104
) — the array a
.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum possible value of the array a
 after the swap has been performed.

Note
For the first test case, we can swap a1
 with a4
 to get the array [5,1,4,2,3
], which has a value of max(5)+max(5,1)+max(5,1,4)+max(5,1,4,2)+max(5,1,4,2,3)=25
.

For the second test case, the current value of the array is max(5)+max(5,1)=10
. If we were to swap a1
 and a2
, a
 would be equal to [1,5
], which has a value of max(1)+max(1,5)=6
, meaning the best option is to not perform a swap.
